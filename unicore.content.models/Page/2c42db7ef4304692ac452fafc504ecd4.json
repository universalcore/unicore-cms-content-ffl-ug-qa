  "content": "Too many births, births too close together and births to adolescent girls\nunder 18 and women over 35 endanger the lives of women and adolescents and\ntheir infants.\n\nFamily planning is one of the most effective ways to improve women's and\nchildren's health and survival. Family planning services provide women and men\nwith information, education and the means to plan when to begin having\nchildren, how many to have, how far apart to have them and when to stop.\nHowever, millions of women of childbearing age, including adolescent girls, do\nnot have control over limiting pregnancies or spacing births, nor do they have\naccess to effective family planning methods.\n\nBoth women and men have the right to choose how many children to have and when\nto have them. With family planning services they are enabled to make informed\ndecisions on pregnancy by taking into account the benefits and risks,\nincluding those related to age and level of access to health services.\n\nEnsuring access to family planning services for women and men, and to\neducation for all children would help prevent many maternal and child deaths\nand disabilities, particularly in countries where marriage occurs early in\nlife. Together these measures can contribute to women's, adolescent girls' and\nchildren's right to survival, health and well-being.\n\n",
